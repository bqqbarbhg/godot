# Adapted from Ming Zou - An Algorithm for Triangulating Multiple 3D Polygons (2013)

The source code in this folder - with the exception of `refine.cpp` is mainly attributed to [Ming Zou](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~taoju/zoum/index.html#) and colleagues from the code provided along with their [2013 paper](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~taoju/zoum/projects/TriMultPoly/index.html).

We focus on the case of 1 boundary polygon to triangulate, while their paper supports triangulating multiple polygons.

Adaptation and code for mesh refinement authored by Tibor Stanko and Emilie Yu.
